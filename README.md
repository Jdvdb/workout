This was a project for a Computer Science SL in IB. It is an application
that can be run through NetBeans and will generate a workout for you and time it
based on simple criteria like what equipment do you want to use and how
intense is the workout. 


What is it:
A NetBeans project written in Java that can be run through the IDE and create a randomized
custom workout.

Running Instructions:
1. Download this folder somewhere on your computer. Open it from NetBeans IDE (10.0.0 or later is 
recommended)

2. Click the 'run' button in the IDE to start the application.

3. Follow the instructions within the workout generator.
